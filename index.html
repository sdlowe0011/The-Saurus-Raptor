        <p class="paragraph1">
            When the world lables you as a book, I guess you become one. It is my mission to educate the entirety of Dinosauria on the infinite possibilities of synonyms.
            Our race are not simply "terrible lizzards", but we also are known as "AWESOME REPTILES" (taken directly from the latin translation)! 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            It is with this mindset that I shall prevail in my endeavor. I will not stop until there is a pen in every tyrannosaur's claw!
            Nor will I hault prior to the day of the sauropod sonnets' arrival. 
            They will all learn, and we as a species shall enter a brighter age of conversations.

                <summary> Q: How can I feel safe being tutored by a carnivore? </summary>
                <p>
                    A: While I do practice hunting, all of my clients can rest assured that I will not eat them or their families. This is legally binding in the paperwork that they fill out on day one.

                <p>
                    A: I do not have a waiting room, and only allow one client in the building at a time. This avoids any other carnivores
                    or myself being blamed if something goes wrong.

                    <summary>Oodipus Rex: The Former Tyrranosaur King of Thebos</summary>
                    <p>
                    When I was egg, Laius Rex (my daddy) told herbivore to kill me. I lived not knowing. I was great prince of Corintho, and saved Thebos from mammal monster. 
                    I marry queen of Thebo, and was great king. King of all Dinosauria! But Jocasto wife was my mommy. Now I am king of disgrace. 
                    This classes have really taught me that being blind and in-sess-too-ous is not the end. I can speak and write good now.

                    As an omnivore, I side with neither the carnivore agenda, nor that of the herbivore. I simply crave a balanced diet of science. 
                    These political issues around what we as a species consume, lead us to believe that we are the center of attention. We are NOT. It is my hypothesis and working theory
                    that the sun is in fact what we rotate around. This is why there is night and day, as well as seasons.

                    <p>
                    The pale creature, whether it was dinosaur or beast I cannot say, has taken everything from me. I pitied
                    the wretch, for has he ever known love or kinship? Was his drive only to feast upon the living? I fear I shall never know, for 
                    we can only view the past as it happened. 
                    </br>
